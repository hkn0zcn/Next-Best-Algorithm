#  ABSTRACT

In the study focuses on single machine scheduling to this purpose a decision support system is designed. The designed decision support system can solve single machine scheduling problems by using "Moore" algorithm, "Bacward-Forward" algorithm and dispatching rules. If there are sequence-dependent setup times in the jobs, a schedule is provided to minimize the total setup time to the user by using "Next-Best" rule. It is focused on objective functions such as minimizing the number of jobs, minimizing the weighted total delay, and minimizing the number of delayed jobs. This system allows to investigate delays, penalties and percentages due to delays. User can solve the single machine problems with a useful interface and ability to compare results.

Key Words: Single Machine Scheduling, Scheduling, Decision Support System
